    <div>Whether youâ€™re looking for 
      massive peat smoke or a budget 
      bourbon for old fashioneds, we've got the 
      best whiskeys for you. There's a lot of great
       whiskey out there. Over the past decade or so, the 
       number of varieties among the best whiskey brands has exploded, 
       presenting tipplers with a mind-boggling array of options. You 
       can now drink bourbon thatâ€™s aged entirely on the ocean, top-rated rye, 
       or Japanese single malts that beat Scotch in blind taste tests. 
        Certain whiskey trends have also become more prevalent. There are bottled-in-bond expressions from 
       new and established distilleries; bourbon, ryes, Irish whiskey, Scotch finished in every 
       type of cask you can think of; more focus on the oft-ignored art of blending; and the rise of American 
       single malt, which will be getting its own legal definition any day now ðŸ¥ƒ. </div>
