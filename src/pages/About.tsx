      <h2>Welcome to Our Whiskey World</h2>
      <p>
        Whether youâ€™re looking for massive peat smoke or a budget bourbon for old fashioneds, 
        we've got the best whiskeys for you. There's a lot of great whiskey out there. Over the 
        past decade or so, the number of varieties among the best whiskey brands has exploded, 
        presenting tipplers with a mind-boggling array of options. You can now drink bourbon thatâ€™s 
        aged entirely on the ocean, top-rated rye, or Japanese single malts that beat Scotch in blind taste tests. 
        Certain whiskey trends have also become more prevalent. There are bottled-in-bond expressions from new 
        and established distilleries; bourbon, ryes, Irish whiskey, Scotch finished in every type of cask you can 
        think of; more focus on the oft-ignored art of blending; and the rise of American single malt, which will be 
        getting its own legal definition any day now ðŸ¥ƒ. For more info about the history of this great product, click
